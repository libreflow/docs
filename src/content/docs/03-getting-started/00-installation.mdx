## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

## Installation

1. Clone the LibreFlow repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/libreflow/libreflow.git
```

2. Navigate to the root directory of the project:

```bash
cd libreflow
```

3. Build the Docker images:

```
Copy code
docker-compose build
```

Building the Docker images may take a few minutes, so sit back and relax. You can grab a cup of coffee or tea while you wait.

4. Start the containers:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Once the images are built, you can start the containers with a single command.
This will spin up the LibreFlow application and its dependencies in Docker
containers. You'll see the application logs in your terminal as the containers
start up.

1. Wait for a few seconds until the containers are up and running. After
   starting the containers, it may take a few seconds for LibreFlow to fully start
   up. You can monitor the logs to see when the application is ready.

2. Access LibreFlow by opening your web browser and entering
   `http://localhost:3000` in the address bar. Once LibreFlow is up and running,
   you can access it by opening your web browser and entering the URL
   `http://localhost:3000`. This will take you to the LibreFlow login screen.

3. You should now see the LibreFlow login screen. If this is your first time
   accessing LibreFlow, you need to create an account by clicking on the
   "Sign Up" button and following the instructions to create your
   account.

4. Once you've created your account, you're ready to start using
   LibreFlow! You can create new projects, add tasks and milestones, and assign
   team members to work on them.

## Notes

- By default, LibreFlow uses port 3000. If you want to use a different port, you can change it in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- If you make any changes to the code, you need to rebuild the Docker images by running `docker-compose build` again.
- To stop the containers, run `docker-compose down` from the project directory.

That's it! You have successfully installed LibreFlow using Docker. Happy project management!
